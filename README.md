I have a total of 4 functions here, the first one (validatePassword) is used to validate the function, the second (passwordChecker) is used in the first function to check if it meets the minimum criteria (1 number, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase). The third function (reversePassword) reverses the string and the fourth function (storePassword) creates an object and may or may not reverse the password depending on the validity of the password itself.
